= Writing posts
:awestruct-layout: base

:next_section: pages

One of Jekyll's best aspects is that it is ``blog aware''. What does this mean,
exactly? Well, simply put, it means that blogging is baked into Jekyll's
functionality. If you write articles and publish them online, this means that
you can publish and maintain a blog simply by managing a folder of text-files
on your computer. Compared to the hassle of configuring and maintaining
databases and web-based CMS systems, this will be a welcome change!

== The Posts Folder

As explained on the link:../structure[directory structure] page, the `_posts`
folder is where your blog posts will live. These files can be either
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown] or
http://textile.sitemonks.com/[Textile] formatted text files, and as long as
they have link:../frontmatter[YAML front-matter], they will be converted from
their source format into an HTML page that is part of your static site.

=== Creating Post Files

To create a new post, all you need to do is create a new file in the `_posts`
directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog
post files to be named according to the following format:

[source,bash]
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit
numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the
file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

[source,bash]
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile

=== Content Formats

All blog post files must begin with link:../frontmatter[YAML front- matter].
After that, it's simply a matter of deciding which format you prefer. Jekyll
supports two popular content markup formats:
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown] and
http://textile.sitemonks.com/[Textile]. These formats each have their own way
of marking up different types of content within a post, so you should
familiarize yourself with these formats and decide which one best suits your
needs.

== Including images and resources

Chances are, at some point, you'll want to include images, downloads, or other
digital assets along with your text content. While the syntax for linking to
these resources differs between Markdown and Textile, the problem of working
out where to store these files in your site is something everyone will face.

Because of Jekyll's flexibility, there are many solutions to how to do this.
One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory
called something like `assets` or `downloads`, into which any images, downloads
or other resources are placed. Then, from within any post, they can be linked
to using the site's root as the path for the asset to include. Again, this will
depend on the way your site's (sub)domain and path are configured, but here
some examples (in Markdown) of how you could do this using the `site.url`
variable in a post.

Including an image asset in a post:

[source,text]
... which is shown in the screenshot below:
![My helpful screenshot]({% raw %}{{ site.url }}{% endraw %}/assets/screenshot.jpg)

Linking to a PDF for readers to download:

[source,text]
... you can [get the PDF]({% raw %}{{ site.url }}{% endraw %}/assets/mydoc.pdf) directly.

[NOTE]
.Link using just the site root URL
You can skip the `{% raw %}{{ site.url }}{% endraw %}` variable if you *know*
your site will only ever be displayed at the root URL of your domain. In this
case you can reference assets directly with just `/path/file.jpg`.

== Displaying an index of posts

It's all well and good to have posts in a folder, but a blog is no use unless
you have a list of posts somewhere. Creating an index of posts on another page
(or in a link:../templates[template]) is easy, thanks to the
http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid[Liquid template language] and its tags. Here's a
basic example of how to create a list of links to your blog posts:

[source,html]
<ul>
  {% raw %}{% for post in site.posts %}{% endraw %}
    <li>
      <a href="{% raw %}{{ post.url }}{% endraw %}">{% raw %}{{ post.title }}{% endraw %}</a>
    </li>
  {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
</ul>

Of course, you have full control over how (and where) you display your posts,
and how you structure your site. You should read more about
link:../templates[how templates work] with Jekyll if you want to know more.

== Post excerpts

Each post automatically takes the first block of text, from the beginning of
the content to the first occurrence of `excerpt_separator`, and sets it as the
`post.excerpt`.  Take the above example of an index of posts. Perhaps you want
to include a little hint about the post's content by adding the first paragraph
of each of your posts:

[source,html]
<ul>
  {% raw %}{% for post in site.posts %}{% endraw %}
    <li>
      <a href="{% raw %}{{ post.url }}{% endraw %}">{% raw %}{{ post.title }}{% endraw %}</a>
      <p>{% raw %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endraw %}</p>
    </li>
  {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
</ul>

If you don't like the automatically-generated post excerpt, it can be
overridden by adding `excerpt` to your post's YAML front-matter.

== Highlighting code snippets

Jekyll also has built-in support for syntax highlighting of code snippets using
Pygments, and including a code snippet in any post is easy. Just use the
dedicated Liquid tag as follows:

[source,text]
{% raw %}{% highlight ruby %}{% endraw %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% raw %}{% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}

And the output will look like this:

[source,ruby]
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end

[TIP]
.Show line numbers
You can make code snippets include line-numbers by adding the word
`linenos` to the end of the opening highlight tag like this:
`{% raw %}{% highlight ruby linenos %}{% endraw %}`.

These basics should be enough to get you started writing your first posts. When
you're ready to dig into what else is possible, you might be interested in
doing things like link:../permalinks[customizing post permalinks] or using
link:../variables[custom variables] in your posts and elsewhere on your site.
